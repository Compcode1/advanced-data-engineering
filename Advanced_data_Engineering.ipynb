    "\n",
    "The main objective of this project is to demonstrate my ability to understand and implement advanced data engineering techniques to optimize both time and memory efficiency. Leveraging efficient data structures and algorithms is crucial for handling large datasets effectively and efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "The techniques I employed in this project include the use of dictionaries for fast lookups, sets for quick membership testing, and binary search for efficient range queries. These methods ensure that data retrieval and processing operations are performed swiftly, reducing overall computational time and memory usage.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In today's data-driven world, time and memory efficiency are vital. Fast data processing enables quicker insights and decision-making, helping businesses stay competitive. Memory-efficient algorithms ensure large datasets are manageable, preventing system overloads. These optimizations are key to advancing data technologies and applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "I will work with a dataset from a fictitious online laptop store and build algorithms dedicated to efficient solutions for a few different business questions about our inventory. In order to do so, I will create a class that represents our inventory. The methods in that class will handle the queries and produce the results. This will include preprocessing the data to make those queries time and memory optimized. The dataset used for this project can be accessed at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/muhammetvarl/laptop-price\n",

The optimized dictionary-based lookup method was approximately 253 times faster than the standard method, and the set-based promotion check method was approximately 2,562 times faster than its standard counterpart. Additionally, the binary search implementation for budget-based queries effectively identified the first laptop exceeding a given price, confirming its utility and efficiency. Overall, the project successfully highlighted the substantial benefits of using advanced data engineering techniques for large-scale data handling.\n",
